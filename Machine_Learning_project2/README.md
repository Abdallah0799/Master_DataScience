# Predict whether a person is diabetic or not

In this notebook we will work with the Pima dataset. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. 
In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

In this notebook we will apply multiple machine learning algorithms (classification) to this dataset, and we will try to find the best one to predict if a person is diabetic or not.
