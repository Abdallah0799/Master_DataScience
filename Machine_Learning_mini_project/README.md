# French cities temperatures

In this notebook, we will apply two machine learning tools on a small dataset : K-Means (for classification) and PCA (for dimensionality reduction). 
The dataset (temper.npz file) contains the average temperatures of 15 french cities for every months of the year. In this work, we would like to classify cities.
